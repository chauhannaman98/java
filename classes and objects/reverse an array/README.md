## Java program to reverse an array

Mandatory terms:
- Create a new class Reverse and the objectname for the class should be "obj"
- Create two methods as follows:

1. Method name = getInput()
2. Type = void
3. Access Specifier = public
4. Argument Type = no arguments

1. Method name = arrayReverse()
2. Type = void
3. Access Specifier = public
4. Argument Type = no arguments

- Access the methods getInput() and arrayReverse() using the object name "obj" from the main method
- The input details are promoted in getInput() and the result were printed in arrayReverse()
